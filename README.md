This is a simple 2D browser game written in Vanilla JS.

I wrote it for practice and not to create the best game ever :)

## Goal of the Game

Explore the level and park in the red parking spaces. Avoid the pigeons and don't crash into other cars or trees.

## Install

1) Clone this repo.
2) Start a live-server. (I use VS code with an extension)
